A local Flask REST API for managing MTG cards and decks.   
This service integrates with the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api) to fetch Magic: The Gathering card data and persists it in a local PostgreSQL database.   
This project was created as part of a capstone project and is still a work in progress   
There is an Angular UI frontend located [here](https://github.com/EricBrown589/NCLab-Python-Capstone-Frontend) (this is also ran locally)


## Features

* Cards
    * Retrieve all cards with optional filters (colors, type)
    * Add new cards from the Scryfall API or increment amount owned if they exist
    * Update the amount owned
    * Delete cards (when amount_owned = 0)
* Decks
    * Create a new deck
    * Retrieve all decks
    * Add cards to deck if they exist
    * Retrieve all cards in a deck
    * Delete a deck
* Database
    * PostgreSQL schema with tables for cards, decks, and deck_cards
    * Automatic table creation on startup
* Error Handling
    * Centralized exception handling with error messages
    * Logging for debugging and monitoring



## Requirements
* Python 3.8+
* PostgreSQL
* Python Packages (see requirements.txt):
    * Flask
    * flask_cors
    * psycopg2
    * requests
Install python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### For the database
* Install PostgreSQL from [their site](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) if you don't already have it.
* In db_conn.py replace the placeholders with the information for your local database
##  Api Endpoints

### Cards
| Method | Endpoint                  | Description                                                                 |
|--------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/cards`                  | List all cards (supports query params: `?colors=Blue&colors=Red&type=Creature`) |
| POST   | `/cards/post`             | Add a new card from the Scryfall API using [exact name](https://scryfall.com/docs/api/cards/named) |
| PUT    | `/cards/update`           | Update the `amount_owned` of a card                                         |
| DELETE | `/cards/delete/<card_id>` | Delete a card if `amount_owned = 0`                                         |

### Decks
| Method | Endpoint                          | Description                              |
|--------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/decks`                          | List all decks                           |
| POST   | `/decks/add`                      | Create a new deck                        |
| DELETE | `/decks/delete/<deck_id>`         | Delete a deck                            |
| GET    | `/decks/<deck_id>/cards`          | List all cards in a deck                 |
| POST   | `/decks/<deck_id>/cards/add`      | Add a card to a deck (by name)           |

## Future Work / Roadmap
Planned improvement and features include:

* Improving how I utilize the Scryfall API to search for cards and return multiple likely cards, instead of using exact name searching
* More advanced filtering
* Improved error handling and messages
* Add testing
* Retrieve more information about the cards from Scryfall for a more in-depth user experience
* Reconfigure how the deleting of a card is handled

Long-Term Ideas:

* Adding authentication and users
* Deploying and hosting somewhere
* Change DB connection handling, possibly with config file 

## Known Issues / Limitations
* DELETE /cards/delete/<card_id> only deletes cards when amount_owned=0. Cards with remaining copies cannot be deleted.
* No input validation for some routes
* Can not search for multi-faced cards as of right now
* Getting image sizes have been an issue

## Status

ðŸš§ This is a capstone project and currently a work in progress. ðŸš§  
Features and API are subject to change as development continues.
